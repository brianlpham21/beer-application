# Beer Index
### Thinkful Node Capstone Project - Server-Side Programming with JavaScript Section - a responsive application that allows users to add and access information regarding beers around the world.

The Beer Index Application allows users to access and retrieve information about beers around the world. The application also allows users the ability to contribute to the Beer Index database, submitting new beers and information.

Users will use Beer Index to retrieve information about their favorite beers, if available in the Beer Index database.

Beer Index is hoping to expand to include authentication that will allow users to sign in and review beers. User reviews will appear on the individual beer pages to show what others have previously and currently rated that select beer.
